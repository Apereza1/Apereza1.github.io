The track tab allows the user to register and view devices that are being tracked. The posts tab allows the user to view and comment on other people's posts about items they may have misplaced. You can also create your post from this tab. Finally, the lost items tab allows you to edit your posts, view comments, and direct message people about your lost item.]
